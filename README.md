# Spam-v-Ham-Detection
Scripts for Spam SMS text detection

This repository is for a final project in a Python university course I took in the summer. I obtained a raw data set of SMS text messages that 
consisted of either spam or 'ham' (non-spam) text messages. 

I used text analytic packages from python to process and clean the data for analysis, and then I used a machine learning algorithms: Multinomial Naive Bayes,
C-classification Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression to predict spam from ham messages.

This repository includes the raw as well as cleaned data sets and a general analysis.
